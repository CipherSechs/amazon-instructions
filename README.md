# Amazon Customers - Instructions for CipherTag

When you start your journey into the world of cryptocurrency, one of the essential things you'll come across is a cryptocurrency wallet.<br>A cryptocurrency wallet is like a digital bank account that allows you to store, send, and receive digital currencies.<br>To ensure the security of your wallet and its contents, wallets often generate a set of seed words, also known as a mnemonic phrase.

These seed words serve as a backup and recovery mechanism for your wallet.<br>They are typically made up of 12, 18, or 24 randomly chosen words from a predefined list of words known as the BIP39 word list.<br>This list consists of 2048 unique words, carefully selected to minimize the chances of generating similar or confusing words.

The purpose of these seed words is to create a human-readable representation of a complex cryptographic key. This means that by remembering or safely storing your seed words, you can regain access to your wallet and funds even if you lose or replace your device.

Whether your wallet provides 12, 18, or 24 seed words, the number of words determines the level of entropy and security of your wallet. Generally, the more words you have, the higher the security. However, it's important to note that each word holds equal importance, so losing any of the words may result in a complete loss of access to your wallet. Therefore, it is crucial to keep your seed words safe, preferably in offline or encrypted storage, and away from prying eyes.

1. Gather your seed words: Retrieve the seed words generated by your hardware wallet. These are usually presented to you during the wallet setup process or can be found in the wallet's settings or backup section. Make sure you have the complete set of seed words ready.
2. Refer to the BIP39 wordlist on GitHub - LINK: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt
3. Match each seed word with its corresponding number and write down the number on the CipherTag packaging provided.  There is a series of yellow boxes that are numbered 1 to 24 for each of your seed words.  Each box will have a single digit number written in it.
   for example if the 3rd word is EMPOWER, it's corresponding number on the BIP39 list is '585'.  The numbers that would be written in each box would be: 0, 5, 8 and 5
4. Repeat this for all the seed words for your hardware/Web3/mobile wallet
5. Use an automatic centre punch(not included) and position the point over the number in the circle for the digit.
6. The grid array is set up so that the FIRST digit of each number from the word list is the left most vertical column.  Each number counts down from '0' top row, '1' middle row and '2' bottom row.  The 2nd, 3rd and 4th digits of each number are marked 0-1 and are horizontal with the 2nd digit being the top horizontal row, the 3rd digit being the middle horizontal row and the 4th digit being the bottom horizontal row.
